1)Machine learning:
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
2)supervised learning:
       *We teach or train data which is well labelled.
       *To learn a mapping from input to output.
       *It can be divided into Classification and Regression.
       *types of algorithms are:Regression,logistic regression and decision tree
 unsupervised learning:
       *It can use unlabelled data and it should act without guidance.
       *Inother words ,it should find patterns in data
       *It can be divided into clustering and association.
       *algorithms can be:Apriori algorithm, K-means.
 3)The “validation dataset” is predominately used to describe the evaluation of models when tuning hyperparameters and data preparation, and the “test dataset” is predominately used to describe the evaluation of a final tuned model when comparing it to other final models.
 4) There are seven significant steps in data preprocessing in Machine Learning:

 1. Acquire the dataset
 2. Import all the crucial libraries
 3. Import the dataset
 4. Identifying and handling the missing values
 5. Encoding the categorical data
 6. Splitting the dataset
 7. Feature scaling
 
 5)Continuous variable:
 It can assume any value within a specified relevent interval of values assumed by the variable
 eg:height,weight.No matter how close we look into two persons height,we always find someone inbetween
 
 Discrete variable:
 It is characterized by the gaps or interruptions in the values that it can assume.
 eg:No of daily admissions to a general hospital.
